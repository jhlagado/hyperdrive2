# Hyperdrive II Source Artifacts

This folder will hold the recovered program artifacts when they are available.
The intended layout mirrors the Hyperdrive repository for consistency.

Expected files:

- `hyperdrive2.bas`: recovered BASIC listing
- `hyperdrive2.wav`: archival tape capture
- `hyperdrive2.tap`: pulse-accurate tape data derived from the WAV
- `hyperdrive2.prg`: reconstructed program file (or Microbee equivalent)
