# Hyperdrive II: The Microbee Sequel

## A Different Adventure

Hyperdrive II is not the VIC-20 game called Hyperdrive. It is a separate title
written by John Hardy for the Microbee, and it only makes a few references to
Ken Stone's original Hyperdrive. The story draws on Ken's ideas, but the game
itself is a fresh reworking built on the BASIC engine that powered Caverns.

In other words: same era, same circle of collaborators, but a different game.

## How It Survived

Hyperdrive II resurfaced on the B side of a cassette tape that otherwise
contained Caverns for the 16K Microbee. That tape was preserved by the Microbee
Software Preservation Project, and the recovery of the original text was helped
along by Alan Laughton (aka ChickenMan), who pointed the way and assisted with
the reconstruction.

This repository exists to keep that recovery intact and to separate Hyperdrive
II's story from the older VIC-20 title.

## What You Will Find Here

This project mirrors the layout of the Hyperdrive repository so the two can be
understood side by side, while still staying clearly distinct.

Primary artifacts (to be added as they become available):

- `src/hyperdrive2.bas`: recovered BASIC source listing
- `src/hyperdrive2.wav`: cassette capture (archival master)
- `src/hyperdrive2.tap`: pulse-accurate tape data derived from the WAV
- `src/hyperdrive2.prg`: reconstructed program file (or Microbee equivalent)

Supporting material and notes:

- [docs/recovery-notes.md](docs/recovery-notes.md): narrative of the recovery
- [docs/peek-poke-notes.md](docs/peek-poke-notes.md): Microbee hardware notes
- `recovery/`: scripts and intermediate outputs used during reconstruction
- `assets/`: images and scans (if any are recovered)

## A Small Context Note

Caverns, Hyperdrive, and Hyperdrive II are related through people and era, but
Hyperdrive II is its own game. It was written by John Hardy, built for the
Microbee, and stands apart from Ken Stone's VIC-20 Hyperdrive.
