# Hyperdrive II Recovery Notes

## Overview

These notes describe how Hyperdrive II was recovered and why this repository
exists. The focus here is narrative: the technical details live in the broader
Microbee preservation work and in the companion Caverns project.

## Background

Hyperdrive II is a science-fiction text adventure for the Microbee, written by
John Hardy. It was based on a story by Ken Stone and an earlier VIC-20 version
of the game, but it was reworked into a new title using the BASIC engine that
powered Caverns. The result is a distinct game, not a port of Ken's Hyperdrive.

## Discovery and Recovery

The Microbee version of Caverns was distributed on cassette. Hyperdrive II was
found on the B side of one such cassette that otherwise contained Caverns for
the 16K Microbee. The tape survived in hobbyist collections and was preserved
through the Microbee Software Preservation Project.

Alan Laughton (aka ChickenMan) played a critical role in compiling preservation
media and helping recover the original program text. His guidance and generosity
made it possible to reconstruct the listing and restore the game to readable
form.

## What Was Preserved

The recovery aims to keep the program intact, not to reinterpret it. The core
goal is to preserve:

- the original listing
- the recovered program data
- the context of where the tape came from

As artifacts are added to this repository, they will live under `src/` and be
accompanied by any scripts or intermediate outputs under `recovery/`.

## Acknowledgements

Thanks to the Microbee Software Preservation Project and especially to Alan
Laughton for preserving the tape collections and helping recover the original
text of Hyperdrive II.
